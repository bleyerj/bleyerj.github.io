This talk first gives a general overview of non-smooth convex variational problems, from their formulation to existing solving methods. These concepts are then illustrated on two applications in the field of structural optimization:

- topology optimization of structural load-bearing capacity [1, 2]
- form-finding of funicular shells [3]
