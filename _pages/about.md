Welcome to my website!

## About

I am a researcher in solid and structural mechanics from [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://ecoledesponts.fr/). I work in [Laboratoire Navier](https://navier-lab.fr/), in the *Architected Materials and Structures* team.

## Research

My research work aims to develop advanced mechanical models and innovative numerical simulation tools for the study of material and structural failure. To achieve this, I draw from a broad spectrum of disciplines, including applied mathematics
(convex analysis and optimization in particular), theoretical and computational mechanics. While a significant portion of my work is at a relatively fundamental methodological level, I also pay special attention to their application in the field of engineering, particularly in civil engineering. In this context, my work aims to address two important societal challenges:
sustainable construction and risk management.

You can find further details in [Research](/research).

## Open science projects

### FEniCS

I am strongly involved in the [FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org) users community. I provide regular help on the
users forum and I maintain an online book called [Numerical tours of Computational
Mechanics using FEniCS](http://bleyerj.github.io/comet-fenicsx), containing educational demos oriented towards solid and structural mechanics applications with FEniCS.

### MFront

I am also contributing to the [MFront project](http://tfel.sourceforge.net), a code generator dedicated to material knowledge, developed at CEA. I have been involved in the [MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport](https://github.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport) project, by developing in particular an interface between MFront and FEniCS.

These developments are now included in the [`dolfinx_materials`](http://github.com/bleyerj/dolfinx_materials) project.

### MEALOR II

I have been a core member of the [MEALOR II Summer school](https://mealor2.sciencesconf.org/). At this occasion, we wrote a collective open-access book, [MEALOR II : Damage Mechanics and Local Approach to Fracture](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10125169).

> The book covers the physics and mechanics of brittle and ductile fracture under monotonic loading, presenting theoretical,
numerical, and experimental aspects as well as the latest applications and research developments of the local approach to fracture
